Foz Notes and Stuff
===================
A static site (mostly formatted in markdown) that contains notes and snippets. This is the source, which can be viewed at [github](http://foz.github.com).

Foz is my nickname, I'm really [Jeremy Seitz](http://somebox.com/about/jeremy), and I sometime blog at [fozworks](http://fozworks.com).
