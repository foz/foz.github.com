=== Mac Droppings (.DS_Store etc)

- To make subversion ignore mac files that get written to remote volumes:

	# add the following line to ~/.subversion/config :

	global-ignores = ._* .DS_Store

=== Cron

- On OSX 10.4, cron files live in /var/cron/tabs
- On OSX 10.5, they are in /usr/lib/cron/tabs

=== Leopard Tricks

- To start the screensaver on the desktop:

	$ /System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework\
	/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/\
	ScreenSaverEngine -background &

- enable time machine over samba:
  $ defaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1

- To make hidden apps in the doc appear transparent (not reversable, but looks great)
  $ defaults write com.apple.Dock showhidden -bool YES
  $ killall Dock

- allow widgets to be dragged onto the desktop
  $ defaults write com.apple.dashboard devmode YES
  $ killall Dock

- # iTunes link arrows: use my library instead of linking to itunes store
  $ defaults write com.apple.iTunes invertStoreLinks -bool YES

- # Set expanded save dialogs as default 
  $ defaults write -g NSNavPanelExpandedStateForSaveMode -bool TRUE

- # change the location of screenshots
  $ defaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Full/Path/To/Folder

=== Safari

 - enable debug mode
 $ defaults write com.apple.Safari WebKitDeveloperExtras -bool true

=== Snow Leopard, Ruby and MySQL

I was finally able to get the mysql 2.8.1 gem after a snow leopard upgrade. After trying many different builds, 64 vs. 32, etc, I ended up:
- removing the existing mysql bundle

  $ sudo rm /Library/Ruby/Site/1.8/universal-darwin10.0/mysql.bundle

- installing 64-bit mysql 5.0/5.1
	pick "Mac OS X 10.5 (x86_64)" as download .dmg installer

- building the gem with this command:

  $ sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" gem install -V mysql -- --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config


=== MPlayer/mencoder ===

Again, macports helps here:

 $ sudo port install mplayer-devel +mencoder_extras

To combine a bunch of movies:

 $ mencoder -oac copy -ovc copy -o "joined.avi" "1.avi" "2.avi"


=== Remote screen sharing, with SSH in the middle as tunnel

You have a mac that's on a remote network, but not publically
accessible. However, a Linux box on that network is.

For example, the remote ssh host (the Linux box) is w.x.y.z.
192.168.1.10 is the mac's ip address on the remote network.

On you mac, ssh to the remote box with port forwarding:

 $ ssh -L 1202:192.168.1.10:5900 user@w.x.y.z

Then, use Command-K to connect to server:

 vnc://localhost:1202
