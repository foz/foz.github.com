"I prefer to make the structure of my programs self-illuminating, eliminating the need for comments. I am not always successful, so while my programs are awaiting perfection, I am writing comments." -  Douglas Crockford, JavaScript: The Good Parts, 1st Edition

"You know the real problem with frameworks?  They demo too well.  Someone shows you their favourite framework and demonstrates how you can build 50% of your application in half an hour!  Great!  That other 50% can’t be hard, can it?  But it turns out that what looked like 50% is actually 5%, and filling in the other 95% gets exponentially more difficult as you approach the 100% mark.  Frameworks are great for building toys, and that fools us — again and again — into assuming they’re good for building products." - Mike Taylor, http://reprog.wordpress.com

"The problem is that big companies are run by business people, not designers or engineers. Too often they deal in numbers rather than good ideas. And this attitude stifles inventiveness and competitive spirit." - James Dyson, http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/article7084570.ece
