[Douglas Crockford](http://www.crockford.com), in [_JavaScript: The Good Parts, 1st Edition_](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517748):

> "I prefer to make the structure of my programs self-illuminating, eliminating the need for comments. I am not always successful, so while my programs are awaiting perfection, I am writing comments." 

[Mike Taylor](http://reprog.wordpress.com/about/) @ [The Reinvigorated Programmer](http://reprog.wordpress.com/2010/03/04/whatever-happened-to-programming-redux-it-may-not-be-as-bad-as-all-that/)
> "You know the real problem with frameworks?  They demo too well.  Someone shows you their favourite framework and demonstrates how you can build 50% of your application in half an hour!  Great!  That other 50% can't be hard, can it?  But it turns out that what looked like 50% is actually 5%, and filling in the other 95% gets exponentially more difficult as you approach the 100% mark.  Frameworks are great for building toys, and that fools us -- again and again -- into assuming they're good for building products."

> "Rule 13 in Strunk and White [amazon.com, amazon.co.uk] is “Omit needless words” — advice as good now as it was when originally published in 1918.  I leave you with S&W’s characteristically terse exposition of this rule:"

>> Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.

[James Dyson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dyson), from a piece in the [Times Online](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/article7084570.ece)
> "The problem is that big companies are run by business people, not designers or engineers. Too often they deal in numbers rather than good ideas. And this attitude stifles inventiveness and competitive spirit."

[Drew Houston](http://www.slideshare.net/gueste94e4c/dropbox-startup-lessons-learned-3836587), CEO of  [Dropbox](http://getdropbox.com), on trying to grow a product through AdWords (which didn't work out well for them)
> "Search is a way to HARVEST demand, not to CREATE it"
